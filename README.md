# cpu

This is the approach to create a minimal RISC-V CPU in JavaScript, later in C and eventually in hardware.
I wanted to do this for a long time, but never had the time to do it. Now I still don't have the time and I am doing it.

## Goals

- Demonstrate how js code could be mapped 1:1 to c code
- Demonstrate how c code could be mapped 1:1 to hardware
- Use most primitive hardware components

## How to use

To compile the test programs, run `make`.
Then run it like `node js/main.js tests/calc.bin`.
